      "butterflies (rhopalocera) are insects that have large, often brightly coloured wings, and a conspicuous, fluttering flight",
      "the group comprises the superfamilieshedyloidea (moth-butterflies in the americas) and papilionoidea",
      "butterfly fossils date to the paleocene, about 56 million years ago.\nbutterflies have a four-stage life cycle, as like most insects they undergo complete metamorphosis",
      "winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on which their larvae, known as caterpillars, will feed",
      "the caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis",
      "when metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off",
      "some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their entire life cycle.\nbutterflies are often polymorphic, and many species make use of camouflage, mimicry, and aposematism to evade their predators.&#91;1&#93; some, like the monarch and the painted lady, migrate over long distances",
      "many butterflies are attacked by parasites or parasitoids, including wasps, protozoans, flies, and other invertebrates, or are preyed upon by other organisms",
      "some species are pests because in their larval stages they can damage domestic crops or trees; other species are agents of pollination of some plants",
      "larvae of a few butterflies (e.g., harvesters) eat harmful insects, and a few are predators of ants, while others live as mutualists in association with ants",
      "culturally, butterflies are a popular motif in the  visual and literary arts",
      "the smithsonian institution says \"butterflies are certainly one of the most appealing creatures in nature\".&#91;2&#93;as in all insects, the body is divided into three sections: the head, thorax, and abdomen",
      "the thorax is composed of three segments, each with a pair of legs",
      "in most families of butterfly the antennae are clubbed, unlike those of moths which may be threadlike or feathery",
      "the long proboscis can be coiled when not in use for sipping nectar from flowers.&#91;17&#93;butterfly larvae, or caterpillars, consume plant leaves and spend practically all of their time searching for and eating food",
      "although most caterpillars are herbivorous, a few species are predators: spalgis epius eats scale insects,&#91;45&#93; while lycaenids such as liphyra brassolis are myrmecophilous, eating ant larvae.&#91;46&#93;when the larva is fully grown, hormones such as prothoracicotropic hormone (ptth) are produced",
      "at this point the larva stops feeding, and begins \"wandering\" in the quest for a suitable pupation site, often the underside of a leaf or other concealed location",
      "there it spins a button of silk which it uses to fasten its body to the surface and moults for a final time",
      "while some caterpillars spin a cocoon to protect the pupa, most species do not",
      "the naked pupa, often known as a chrysalis, usually hangs head down from the cremaster, a spiny pad at the posterior end, but in some species a silken girdle may be spun to keep the pupa in a head-up position.&#91;38&#93; most of the tissues and cells of the larva are broken down inside the pupa, as the constituent material is rebuilt into the imago",
      "the structure of the transforming insect is visible from the exterior, with the wings folded flat on the ventral surface and the two halves of the proboscis, with the antennae and the legs between them.&#91;13&#93;the reproductive stage of the insect is the winged adult or imago",
      "the surface of both butterflies and moths is covered by scales, each of which is an outgrowth from a single epidermal cell",
      "the head is small and dominated by the two large compound eyes",
      "these are capable of distinguishing flower shapes or motion but cannot view distant objects clearly",
      "colour perception is good, especially in some species in the blue/violet range",
      "the antennae are composed of many segments and have clubbed tips (unlike moths that have tapering or feathery antennae)",
      "the sensory receptors are concentrated in the tips and can detect odours",
      "taste receptors are located on the palps and on the feet",
      "the mouthparts are adapted to sucking and the mandibles are usually reduced in size or absent",
      "the first maxillae are elongated into a tubular proboscis which is curled up at rest and expanded when needed to feed",
      "the first and second maxillae bear palps which function as sensory organs",
      "some species have a reduced proboscis or maxillary palps and do not feed as adults.&#91;13&#93;the thorax of the butterfly is devoted to locomotion",
      "each of the three thoracic segments has two legs (among nymphalids, the first pair is reduced and the insects walk on four legs)",
      "the second and third segments of the thorax bear the wings",
      "the leading edges of the forewings have thick veins to strengthen them, and the hindwings are smaller and more rounded and have fewer stiffening veins",
      "the forewings and hindwings are not hooked together (as they are in moths) but are coordinated by the friction of their overlapping parts",
      "the front two segments have a pair of spiracles which are used in respiration.&#91;13&#93;the abdomen consists of ten segments and contains the gut and genital organs",
      "the front eight segments have spiracles and the terminal segment is modified for reproduction",
      "the male has a pair of clasping organs attached to a ring structure, and during copulation, a tubular structure is extruded and inserted into the female's vagina",
      "a spermatophore is deposited in the female, following which the sperm make their way to a seminal receptacle where they are stored for later use",
      "in both sexes, the genitalia are adorned with various spines, teeth, scales and bristles, which act to prevent the butterfly from mating with an insect of another species.&#91;13&#93; after it emerges from its pupal stage, a butterfly cannot fly until the wings are unfolded",
      "a newly emerged butterfly needs to spend some time inflating its wings with hemolymph and letting them dry, during which time it is extremely vulnerable to predators.&#91;56&#93;butterflies use their antennae to sense the air for wind and scents",
      "the antennae come in various shapes and colours; the hesperiids have a pointed angle or hook to the antennae, while most other families show knobbed antennae",
      "the antennae are richly covered with sensory organs known as sensillae",
      "a butterfly's sense of taste is coordinated by chemoreceptors on the tarsi, or feet, which work only on contact, and are used to determine whether an egg-laying insect's offspring will be able to feed on a leaf before eggs are laid on it.&#91;63&#93; many butterflies use chemical signals, pheromones; some have specialized scent scales (androconia) or other structures (coremata or \"hair pencils\" in the danaidae).&#91;64&#93; vision is well developed in butterflies and most species are sensitive to the ultraviolet spectrum",
      "many species show sexual dimorphism in the patterns of uv reflective patches.&#91;65&#93; colour vision may be widespread but has been demonstrated in only a few species.&#91;66&#93;&#91;67&#93; some butterflies have organs of hearing and some species make stridulatory and clicking sounds.&#91;68&#93;as in many other insects, the lift generated by butterflies is more than can be accounted for by steady-state, non-transitory aerodynamics",
      "studies using vanessa atalanta in a wind tunnel show that they use a wide variety of aerodynamic mechanisms to generate force",
      "these include wake capture, vortices at the wing edge, rotational mechanisms and the weis-fogh 'clap-and-fling' mechanism",
      "butterflies are able to change from one mode to another rapidly.&#91;71&#93;queen alexandra's birdwing is the largest butterfly in the world",
      "the species is endangered, and is one of only three insects (the other two being butterflies as well) to be listed on appendix i of cites, making international trade illegal.&#91;77&#93;declining butterfly populations have been noticed in many areas of the world, and this phenomenon is consistent with the rapidly decreasing insect populations around the world",
      "at least in the western united states, this collapse in the number of most species of butterflies has been determined to be driven by global climate change, specifically, by warmer autumns.&#91;98&#93;&#91;99&#93;"
